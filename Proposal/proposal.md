# Game Proposal.

Title Ideas
- Stay Afloat (current)
- Below C
- Man Over Board (like keyboard. get it? cause you're also a man over a board)

QUESTIONS:
- Should the pointer (the box that surrounds the next key to be typed) progress when any key is pressed, or only when the correct key has been pressed? I think the former would make for smoother gameplay, but it would mean we would have to change the colours of the correctly-typed letters if we wanted the player to know whether or not they'd made a mistake.
- If we decide to implement an air mechanic, we should probably have a meter on screen (something basic, like a loading-screen meter). It would decrease at a consistent pace while the swimmer is underwater. How should it increase when the swimmer is above water? Consistently, twice as fast, maybe?

## General Game Overview

- The intial splash screen shows the game title. The buttons labeled as "1 Player" and "2 Player" appear once the game setup is complete.
- In both game modes, the player must correctly type a string of words at the bottom of their screen in order to keep a swimmer from drowning.
- There are two options for failstates, one easier to implement and one more interesting for the player:
  1. Touching the sea floor (the line at the bottom of the water) is a game-over.
  2. Remaining too long with the swimmer's head below the surface causes a game-over.

## Sound Effects

- A splash sound plays every time the swimmer bobs its head above the water.
- An ascending "bwoop" noise plays when a correct key is pressed and the swimmer bobs upward.
- A few descending notes play when the player loses.
- A few ascending notes play if the player wins (2 player version only).
- Background music: An original composition with basic synthesized notes. The speed of the song will increase as the game difficulty increases.
